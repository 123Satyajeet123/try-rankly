## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Component: `UnifiedTopicRankingsSection.tsx`

**Key Features:**
1. **Smart Data Filtering:**
   ```typescript
   return dashboardData.metrics.topicRankings
     .filter((topicRanking: any) => topicRanking.competitors && topicRanking.competitors.length > 0)
     .filter((topic: any) => topic.rankings.length > 0) // Only topics with actual rankings
   ```

2. **Proper Ranking Order:**
   ```typescript
   rankings: topicRanking.competitors
     .sort((a: any, b: any) => a.rank - b.rank) // Ensure proper ranking order
     .slice(0, 5) // Show top 5
   ```

3. **Enhanced Tooltips:**
   ```typescript
   <TooltipContent>
     <p className="text-xs">
       <strong>{ranking.name}</strong><br/>
       Visibility Score: {ranking.score}%<br/>
       Rank: #{ranking.rank}
     </p>
   </TooltipContent>
   ```

### Data Transform: `dataTransform.ts`

**Topic Rankings Function:**
```typescript
export function transformTopicsToTopicRankings(
  topics: BackendTopic[],
  aggregatedMetrics: BackendAggregatedMetrics[]
): TopicRanking[] {
  return topics.map(topic => {
    const topicMetrics = aggregatedMetrics.find(metric => 
      metric.scope === 'topic' && metric.scopeValue === topic.name
    )
    
    // ✅ Use visibility rankings for topic rankings (most relevant metric)
    const competitors = topicMetrics?.brandMetrics
      ? transformBrandMetricsToCompetitors(topicMetrics.brandMetrics, 'visibility')
      : []

    return {
      id: topic._id,
      topic: topic.name,
      competitors
    }
  })
}
```
