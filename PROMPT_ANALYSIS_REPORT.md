## Areas for Improvement

### Minor Issue: Branded Percentage ⚠️

**Current**: 15% (3 branded out of 20)  
**Target**: 20% (4 branded out of 20)  
**Needed**: 1 more branded prompt

#### Recommendation:
Add 1 additional branded prompt to either:
- Membership Rewards category (brings to 3/11 = 27%)
- OR Contactless Payments category (brings to 2/9 = 22%)

**Example Additional Branded Prompt:**
- "How does American Express SmartEarn™ welcome benefits compare to other entry-level cards?"
- "Should I consider American Express SmartEarn™ for contactless payments?"
- "American Express SmartEarn™ - is it good for earning rewards on dining?"
