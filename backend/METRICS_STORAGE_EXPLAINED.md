# Metrics Storage & Data Flow - Complete Explanation

## ‚úÖ YES - Competitor Metrics ARE Being Tracked!

Your concern is valid - let me show you **exactly** what's stored and how it flows to the frontend.

---

## üìä Current State After Step 4

### What's In `test-flow-step4-data.json`:
```json
{
  "testResults": {
    "totalTests": 16,
    "avgVisibilityScore": 97,
    "brandMentionRate": 50
  }
}
```
**This is just a SUMMARY!** The real detailed data is in MongoDB.

## üóÑÔ∏è What's ACTUALLY Stored in Database

### Per-Test Storage (PromptTest Collection):

Each test result contains metrics for **ALL BRANDS** (your brand + competitors):

```javascript
{
  _id: "...",
  promptId: "...",
  llmProvider: "perplexity",
  queryType: "Commercial Investigation",
  rawResponse: "Full LLM response text...",
  
  // SCORECARD (User's brand only)
  scorecard: {
    brandMentioned: true,
    brandPosition: 1,
    visibilityScore: 99,
    overallScore: 99,
    citationPresent: true,
    citationType: "direct_link",
    competitorsMentioned: ["PayPal", "Square", "Adyen"]
  },
  
  // BRAND METRICS (ALL brands - user + competitors)
  brandMetrics: [
    {
      brandName: "Stripe",           // ‚Üê YOUR BRAND
      mentioned: true,
      firstPosition: 1,
      rankPosition: 1,                // Ranked 1st in this response
      mentionCount: 7,
      totalWordCount: 130,
      sentences: [                    // All sentences mentioning Stripe
        { text: "...", position: 0, wordCount: 25 },
        { text: "...", position: 2, wordCount: 18 },
        // ... more sentences
      ],
      citations: [                    // Citations for Stripe
        { url: "https://stripe.com", type: "brand" }
      ]
    },
    {
      brandName: "PayPal",           // ‚Üê COMPETITOR 1
      mentioned: true,
      firstPosition: 1,
      rankPosition: 2,                // Ranked 2nd
      mentionCount: 9,
      totalWordCount: 147,
      sentences: [ /* ... */ ],
      citations: [ /* ... */ ]
    },
    {
      brandName: "Square",           // ‚Üê COMPETITOR 2
      mentioned: true,
      firstPosition: 1,
      rankPosition: 3,
      mentionCount: 6,
      totalWordCount: 113,
      sentences: [ /* ... */ ],
      citations: [ /* ... */ ]
    },
    {
      brandName: "Adyen",            // ‚Üê COMPETITOR 3
      mentioned: true,
      firstPosition: 1,
      rankPosition: 4,
      mentionCount: 6,
      totalWordCount: 115,
      sentences: [ /* ... */ ],
      citations: [ /* ... */ ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Current State:** 8 tests stored, each with metrics for 3 brands (HDFC Bank Freedom Credit Card + 2 competitors)

## üìà What Gets Aggregated in Step 5

Step 5 takes the raw `brandMetrics` and calculates aggregated metrics for **EACH BRAND**:

### AggregatedMetrics Collection Structure:
