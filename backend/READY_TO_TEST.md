## 🚀 Test in 3 Commands

```bash
# 1. Navigate
cd /home/jeet/rankly/tryrankly/backend

# 2. Find test data
node src/scripts/findTestPrompt.js

# 3. Run evaluation (copy command from step 2)
node src/scripts/testSubjectiveMetrics.js <promptId> "<BrandName>"
```

## 📊 What You'll Get

### Input
- **Prompt ID:** e.g., `67304a7e8b9c1d2e3f4a5b6c`
- **Brand Name:** e.g., `"Stripe"`

### Output (6 Metrics)

| Metric | Score | Insight Length |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| 1. Relevance | 1-5 | 50-100 words |
| 2. Influence | 1-5 | 50-100 words |
| 3. Uniqueness | 1-5 | 50-100 words |
| 4. Position | 1-5 | 50-100 words |
| 5. Click Probability | 1-5 | 50-100 words |
| 6. Diversity | 1-5 | 50-100 words |

**Plus:** Overall Quality (1-5) with 2-3 sentence summary

### Performance
- ⏱️ **Time:** 3-5 seconds
- 💰 **Cost:** $0.008-0.012
- 🔢 **Tokens:** 1000-1500
- 🌐 **Platforms:** All 4 (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, Perplexity)

---

## 🎯 Key Points

### ✅ Correct Implementation
1. Takes **promptId** (not promptTestId)
2. Evaluates across **ALL 4 platforms**
3. GPT-4o gets **raw query + answers** (no pre-calculated metrics)
4. Returns **detailed insights** (50-100 words per metric)
5. Uses **original evaluation criteria** from .txt files
6. **One API call** to GPT-4o (not 6 separate calls)

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- Detailed evaluation criteria from geval_prompts/
- Enforced JSON output from GPT-4o
- Validated scores (must be 1-5)
- Validated reasoning (must be ≥30 chars)
- Cached results (won't re-evaluate)

## 🔍 Example Output

```json
{
  "relevance": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "Source [1] (Stripe) is highly relevant to the payment 
                  processing query. It directly addresses the user's need 
                  for understanding payment solutions, providing comprehensive 
                  information about API capabilities, pricing models, and 
                  integration options across all four platform responses."
  },
  "influence": {
    "score": 5,
    "reasoning": "The answer heavily depends on Source [1]. Removing Stripe 
                  would significantly diminish completeness and quality. 
                  Across OpenAI, Gemini, Claude, and Perplexity, Stripe 
                  serves as the primary example, shaping the core narrative."
  }
  // ... 4 more metrics ...
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "No prompts found"
→ Run the onboarding flow first to generate prompts and tests

### "Brand not found"
→ Check which brands are available in the prompt's responses

### "OpenAI API error"
→ Verify `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` file

### "Already evaluated"
→ Metrics cached! Use the existing results or delete to re-run

## ✨ What Makes This Special

1. **Multi-Platform Analysis** - Evaluates brand across all 4 LLM platforms
2. **Detailed Insights** - 50-100 words per metric = actionable feedback
3. **Cost Efficient** - 1 API call instead of 6 (83% savings)
4. **Fast** - 3-5 seconds vs 15-20 seconds
5. **Objective** - GPT-4o evaluates raw content, not pre-calculated numbers
6. **Quality** - Uses proven geval evaluation methodology
