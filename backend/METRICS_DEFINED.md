## ðŸ“Š **Aggregated Metrics (Calculated in Step 5)**

These are calculated FROM the raw metrics above:

### **1. Visibility Score** (0-100)
```
Formula: (mentionScore Ã— 0.4) + (positionScore Ã— 0.3) + (citationScore Ã— 0.3)
- mentionScore = min(100, (mentionCount / 3) Ã— 100)
- positionScore = based on firstPosition
- citationScore = min(100, (citations / 2) Ã— 100)
```

### **2. Share of Voice** (%)
```
Formula: (Tests where brand mentioned / Total tests) Ã— 100
Example: Stripe appears in 16/16 tests = 100%
```

### **3. Average Position**
```
Formula: Average of all firstPosition values
Example: Stripe appears in sentences [1, 2, 1, 5, ...] = avg 1.13
```

### **4. Depth of Mention** (score)
```
Formula: (Total word count / Total response words) Ã— weighting factor
Example: 3,167 words about Stripe / 69,000 total words = high depth
```

### **5. Word Count** (total)
